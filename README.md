## ----------> End to End ML Projec <------------
### Tech Stack:
  Programming Language: Python 🐍
  Framework: Flask 🌐
  ML Libraries: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, CatBoost, XGBoost
  Deployment: AWS Beanstalk ☁️
### 1️⃣ Project Structure & Setup
Designed a modular project structure to simplify scalability and maintenance.
Incorporated logging and exception handling to streamline debugging and error tracking.
### 2️⃣ Problem Understanding & Data Preprocessing
Identified key objectives and performed EDA to extract insights.
Preprocessed data by handling missing values and outliers. Feature scaling and encoding were critical steps to improve data quality.
### 3️⃣ Data Ingestion & Transformation
Automated a data ingestion pipeline to fetch and process raw data.
Built a data transformation module for tasks like feature scaling and one-hot encoding, ensuring clean inputs for the model.
### 4️⃣ Model Training & Performance Comparison
Implemented and tested various regression models, including:
🔹 Random Forest
🔹 Gradient Boosting
🔹 CatBoost
🔹 Linear Regression (Best Accuracy!)
Compared models using metrics like R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Linear Regression outperformed other models due to its simplicity and ability to handle the dataset effectively.
### 5️⃣ Building Prediction Pipelines
   -->Developed a modular prediction pipeline to handle unseen data inputs dynamically.
   -->Validated the pipeline by simulating real-world scenarios to ensure its robustness.
   -->Implemented a preprocessor that automatically applies the same data transformations used during training, avoiding data leakage.
   -->Designed the pipeline to handle edge cases (e.g., missing features in input data).
   -->Ensured the prediction pipeline integrates seamlessly with the deployed API for efficient real-time predictions.
### 6️⃣ Deployment
   ->Leveraged AWS Beanstalk for a smooth and scalable deployment process.
   ->Used Flask to create REST APIs for model inference, enabling external applications to fetch predictions effortlessly.
   ->Configured environment variables in AWS for better security (e.g., API keys and database credentials).
   ->Validated the deployment using stress tests to ensure the model could handle multiple concurrent requests.
   ->Set up monitoring for the deployed model using AWS CloudWatch, ensuring consistent performance and quick detection of issues.
